Test Plan for Personal Stage Filtering in MyTasks
===================================================

Expected Data (from database):
-------------------------------
User 177 (Suraj Yadav) has tasks with personal stages:
- Stage 52 (Inbox): 36 tasks
- Stage 53 (Today): 1 task
- Stage 54 (This Week): 4 tasks
- Stage 55 (This Month): 3 tasks
- Stage 56 (Later): 1 task
- Stage 57 (Done): 2 tasks

Sample tasks in Inbox (52):
- "Test Task Creation"
- "Release & Bug Fixes"
- "Testing task Creation From Devicee"

Test Steps:
-----------
1. Open the app and navigate to MyTasks
2. Check console output for:
   - "Loading personal stages for user 177"
   - Personal stages loaded (should show 8 stages including "All")
   - ListHeader labels set (All, Inbox, Today, This Week, etc.)
   - Filter IDs set (null, 52, 53, 54, etc.)

3. Click on "Inbox" filter button
4. Check console output for:
   - "Personal Stage filter selected - filterKey: 52"
   - "Parsing stageId: 52"
   - "Applying personal stage filter - Stage ID: 52, User ID: 177, Account ID: 20"
   - "Found X tasks matching stage and assignee"
   - "Found 36 tasks for personal stage 52"

5. Verify the task list shows:
   - "Test Task Creation"
   - "Release & Bug Fixes"
   - "Testing task Creation From Devicee"
   - And other tasks with personal_stage = 52

6. Click on "Today" filter button
7. Should show 1 task with personal_stage = 53

8. Click on "This Week" filter button
9. Should show 4 tasks with personal_stage = 54

Troubleshooting:
----------------
If filters don't work:
1. Check if filterKey is being passed correctly
2. Check if parseInt() is working
3. Check if type comparison is correct (use parseInt on both sides)
4. Check if tasks have correct personal_stage values
5. Check console for "Task X matches stage AND assignee" messages
